# Observations
Here I examine how archaeologists rely on various tools, experiences and social relations when constructing knowledge in fieldwork settings.
I observed various instances of archaeologists conducting fieldwork and framed their actions as a series of cultural and epistemic experiences, whereby archaeologists contributed to the production of a communal data stream and acted in ways that corresponded with professional norms and expectations.
I focused my attention on how the community of practice was supported and upheld by combined organizational and technical infrastructures, which effectively governed how knowledge was produced, evaluated and legitimized.

## Fieldwork as Practical, Independent and Improvised Experience
In the cases I observed, fieldwork was considered the primary domain under which archaeological evidence is constituted, and was generally considered as a root from which subsequent work depends and originates.<sup>[A1](#sec-A1), [A2](#sec-A2), [A3](#sec-A3)</sup>
Moreover, the field sites were settings where a methodologically diverse group of people came together with some sense of common purpose, where experimental methods were attempted, and where unprintable stories and gossip originated and were retold.
The richly textured social experiences and the cooperative spirit that emerged from performing collective labour in relatively rough environments, and which  called for a practical, hands-on work ethic, directly informed the constitution of archaeological knowledge at and beyond the site.

The sites where my observations were based were located in outdoor and remote settings,^[While urban fieldwork is common, it was not practiced in any of the cases I examined.] and archaeologists had to modify these rough physical environments so that they could more easily support scientific intervention.
For instance, archaeologists cleared weeds and broke boulders that inhibited excavation.<sup>[A3](#sec-A3), [A4](#sec-A4), [A5](#sec-A5), [A6](#sec-A6)</sup>

Although fieldwork could be slow and meticulous compared to the range of possible ways forward (i.e. removing sediment by hand with a trowel or mattock, rather than using heavy equipment), there was also a strong impetus to work quickly.<sup>[A7](#sec-A7)</sup>
Experienced excavators were able to recognize when it was necessary to change gears, and were able to balance care with speed.
Fieldworkers typically focused on getting the job done cheaply by working with the tools and resources that are on hand and within budget.<sup>[A4](#sec-A4), [A5](#sec-A8), [A6](#sec-A9), [B1](#sec-B1)</sup>
In this vein, the practices I observed tended to rely on flexible tools that participants could wield in various ways or could modify for use in various circumstances.<sup>[B1](#sec-B1)</sup>
These tools typically derived from non-archaeological occupations, such as the construction or forestry industries, and were easy and inexpensive to purchase (and replace) from hardware stores.<sup>[A10](#sec-A10)</sup>
For instance, at Case A, where the soil is quite rocky and dry, fieldworkers preferred to use a hand tool designed for stripping wallpaper instead of the more typical mason's trowel.<sup>[A11](#sec-A11)</sup>
They generally preferred to use tools that were relatively easy to repair or modify for optimal use; trowels could be sharpened, the worn-out grip on a sledgehammer could be replaced with scrap rubber, and buckets could be patched with duct tape [@batist2021: 1742].<sup>[A12](#sec-A12)</sup>
Simple tools and materials were often recombined on the fly to serve practical and often one-off functions [cf. @delaet2000].

A great example of the practical, independent and improvised nature of fieldwork is how Theo, a very experienced trench supervisor who would also eventually become Case A's field director, found a way to extend a rod so that he could take accurate measurements.
This is elicited in @fig-nail:

::: {#fig-nail layout-ncol="1"}
**From my field notes:**

After hammering in the rebar and vertically aligning the string, it is only level at a point that is higher than the rebar.
He told me to go grab the other rebar in the corner, though it is massive.
Tried hammering it in, but it was clear that it would get blown over by the wind.
I offered to hold it steady but instead he told me to rummage in his bag and find a nail and masking tape.
He attached the long nail to the rebar, adding 4-5 inches to its length. He then proceeded, with my assistance, to tie the string around the nail, clip it on securely, and secure the line down with a rock. Regarding securing the line down with a rock, this was a challenge for me yesterday, as well as when I did this for the earlier section this morning.
I needed to find the right kind of rock, which was not too big, but still dense.
It needed to be not too rough, but with sharp angular corners.
This was never made explicit; after two failed attempts, first with a large rugged rock, and then with a smaller, less rugged rock, he picked up one and gave it to me, saying  "something like this".
I wound the string around it, leaving some slack, and then positioned the rock in a way that would render the line taut, by rotating it or securing it around others.<sup>[A12](#sec-A12)</sup>

A transcript of the author's field notes recalling how Theo, a very experienced trench supervisor at Case A, improvised a solution to a practical problem using tools and resources on hand and through an indirect style of communication.
:::

This anecdote illustrates the improvised and iterative process of assembling a practical workaround for a minor problem.
We tried working with various combinations of materials, from Theo's own toolkit and from the natural environment, to extend the length of the rod and ensure that it can stand steady in the wind.
This work was driven by a desired outcome, and was both constrained and made feasible by the materials that were available at hand.
Based on his experience, Theo assessed the situation and extended the rod in a way that enabled him to achieve his objective without introducing confounding factors that would prompt others down the line to question the record he produced.
In other words, he established a controlled environment that suited his specific and ephemeral circumstances and in a manner that could not necessarily be transposed to alternative settings.

Archaeological fieldwork would not be possible without this kind of improvised problem-solving behaviour, initiated and operationalized by fieldworkers themselves.
In situations like that which I articulated in @fig-nail, the fieldworker constitutes a creative agent who assembles an apparatus through which they may collect meaningful information.
He operates within a space that he is intimately familiar with, and which constitues a domain under his control, using materials available at arms reach and whose properties and affordances he is intuitively aware of.
However, he does not work in isolation, and is in fact driven by an impetus to record specific bits of information to feed into a database, so as to enable further analysis that he plays no part in.
In what follows, I draw more focused attention toward the emerging sociotechnical tensions between these localized systems of data capture and their integration within broader sociotechnical systems that direct the flow of information.

## Capturing visual media
Visual media have long been an integral component of archaeological practice.
Their main purpose is to create a representation of an object in a way that portrays its physical proportions and spatial configuration.
Archaeologists accomplish this using systems that transpose spatial configurations onto mutable and mobile media.
With photography, this involves sensing and storing the patterned reflections of photons, whereas illustration involves creating parallel environments on paper or digital planes and establishing means of translating observed spatial relationships onto them.
As we shall see, these means for capturing an image of an archaeological object of interest contain different underlying mentalities, value regimes and affordances for future use of the outcomes they produce.
These distinctions, and the ways that they have been incorporated into archaeological information management systems, reflect broader tensions regarding pressures to digitize and automate fairly common archaeological practices.

In my work at Case A I observed how archaeologists illustrate trench sections in fieldwork settings.
Archaeological illustration operated by establishing a set of parallel environments and a means of translating spatial configurations between them.
This was accomplished by imagining the object of interest as if it was overlaid upon a two-dimensional grid, with a parallel grid represented on a sheet of graph paper.
While largely abstract, the grid imposed on the trench section contained certain physical components.
Specifically, archaeologists established physical reference points using taut, level strings laid out horizontally across the trench, secured with nails or rebar.
Tape measures were aligned along the string and the vertical span of the trench.
A nail placed in the corner of the trench was also established as a known spatial point, whose precise location was determined by spatial data specialists using theodolites, GPS, total stations or other means at their disposal.
The height of the string and the positions of the trench corners were determined in relation to this fixed point.
A similar grid was established on a page of graph paper, and congruent reference lines were drawn in relation to a fixed point marked on the page.<sup>[A13](#sec-A13), [A14](#sec-A14), [A15](#sec-A15), [A16](#sec-A16)</sup>

After establishing a congruent grid on the page, the illustrator identified significant spatial points along the baulk and determined their parallel positions on the page in relation to the reference lines.
For example, the illustrator identified the position of a boulder's corner by counting the number of centimetres below the reference string and the number of centimetres from the edge of the trench, and marked a dot on the page at congruent distances from the reference points that demarcate the edges of the grid.
After plotting a series of points in this manner, the illustrator connected them with curves or line segments, attempting to match their perception of the boundaries between materials.<sup>[A13](#sec-A13), [A14](#sec-A14), [A15](#sec-A15), [B2](#sec-B2)</sup>
She then erased any arbitrary control lines and reference points, traced the pencil-drawn lines with ink to enhance visual contrast and clarity, and applied patterned in-filling to the shapes between the plotted lines to represent different kinds of objects.
The illustrator also demarcated the precise location where a sample specimen was taken by plotting icons at the appropriate grid coordinate, and annotated the image with the elevations of significant points.<sup>[A13](#sec-A13), [A14](#sec-A14)</sup>

---

The illustrator then identifies significant spatial points that correspond with meaningful material intersections, for instance the corners of large boulders or points along a stratigraphic interface, and expresses the points' positions in terms that specify the number of centimetres distance between a point and the string and between a point and the position of the intersecting baulk, with reference to the measuring tapes.
The illustrator then places a dot on the page at a position that represents an equivalent intersection, but at a smaller scale.
Plotting more points makes it easier to draw a more precise line, but experienced illustrators are relatively adept at matching the observed interfaces on the page.\textsuperscript{\ref{A147} \ref{B37}}

After all the significant lines are drawn, the illustrator erases any arbitrary control lines and reference points, and traces the pencil-drawn lines with ink to enhance visual contrast and clarity.
They then apply patterned in-filling to the shapes between the plotted lines to represent different kinds of objects.
For instance, the illustrator may represent clay soils with diagonal lines, and fill the outlines of boulders with fine, speckled dots.
The illustrator may also demarcate the precise location where a sample specimen was taken by plotting an icon at the appropriate grid coordinate, or may annotate the image with the elevations of significant points as determined with reference to fixed spatial points that the spatial data specialist recorded.\textsuperscript{\ref{A147}}

Although I have not observed artefact illustration for the purposes of this study, it involves a very similar process (see @adkins1989 and @griffiths2007 for more detailed overviews of artefact illustration procedures).
However there is greater emphasis on applying visual cues through use of common conventions, which convey specific information about the objects they represent [@banning2020: 351-361].
For instance, the top and bottom points are more explicitly articulated to facilitate comparing drawings of the same artefact from different spatial perspectives (i.e. dorsal, ventral and edge perspectives), and line widths and dotting convey specific meanings regarding the artefact's physical properties, such as to account for weathering processes or whether a broken edge is ancient or a product of modern intervention.

---

Illustration in fieldwork settings was sometimes performed independently but it is very common for two people to collaborate on this task.
In such cases, they communicated using language that reflects the mindset that this process calls for.
For example, I observed Jane --- a promising student and trench assistant --- standing at the edge of the trench saying something like "at x on the horizon, it's y down", and Theo who was holding the drawing pad would reply either with an acknowledgement that he understood the coordinate and had finished plotting the point, or by asking her to repeat it in case he did not hear her properly.<sup>[A14](#sec-A14), [A15](#sec-15), [A16](#sec-A16)</sup>
They established a comfortable rhythm, and adjusted the volume and tone of their voices to account for any initial miscommunication or difficulty hearing the sound of the others' voice over loud gusts of wind.
The terms they used were ones they adopted on the fly, and they needed only a basic understanding of the principles behind the technique to formulate a script that included the identification of vertical and horizontal variables, their mutable values, a connective term to draw an association between them, and an exclamation to indicate that a coordinate had been successfully recorded and that they should continue on to the next point.<sup>[A14](#sec-A14)</sup>
This is the framework for language that allows mutual comprehension and translation of physical spatial configurations onto the page.
Their speech was flexible and adaptable to local conditions and circumstances, while also being driven by a need to produce a stable information output.
Attempts are made to strip the information object of the processes through which it was produced and to make it seem more definitive, but it is clearly a hand-drawn document.

It is also notable that archaeological illustrators found it necessary to work with material with which they were familiar, or alongside people who already had such familiarity.<sup>[A14](#sec-A14), [A16](#sec-A16)</sup>
For instance, a trench supervisor had to be present to help identify where a stratigraphic interface should be delineated, or to identify which boulders or other materials jutting out from the baulk were worth recording.
This supports the notion that section drawings serve as schematic documents that convey archaeological encounters, rather than as a literal representations of objects of interest.

Contrast this with archaeological photography, another means of imaging that archaeologists commonly employ in their fieldwork.
Photography differs from illustration in that it captures an object's likeness as a whole, and does not account for the storied process through which the object obtains archaeological meaning.
Photography does involve active decision-making, like deciding what is worth recording, or deciding how to adjust the environment and how to configure the camera to account for the photographer's understanding of how their camera will respond in a specific set of conditions.
But, by-and-large, archaeological photography is more concerned with obtaining a record of an object rather than a representation of objects in relation to other forms of archaeological information.
This is evident through the fact that, in the cases I investigated, much of a photograph's significance stemmed from its associations with records made about it.
In the excerpt presented in @fig-photolog-convo from an interview with Chris (one of Case B's co-directors and the person in charge of photography on site), he explains how each photo was recorded in a ``photo log'' or a spreadsheet that identifies the objects photographed and documents the circumstances under which the photos were taken.

::: {#fig-photolog-convo layout-ncol=1}
**Zack:** Can I get a brief shot of the page, what you're writing there?\
**Chris:** Sure.\
**Zack:** Yeah, it's just basically a photo log.\
**Chris:** Yeah, just a photo log, just making little notes, and then I transfer it to a, like a spreadsheet.\
**Zack:** You keep track of the photo number? Like the file name?\
**Chris:** Yeah, so everything, so what I do is I copy like a reference to the image file name in that spreadsheet, and every photo, and each photo is labelled like [redacted identifier] _P1, _P2, like for each, each, each umm stratigraphic unit.<sup>[B3](#sec-B3)</sup>

Conversation with the person in charge of photography on site at Case B, who explains the process of recording a photo log.
:::

Some information about the photo was also hard-coded into photos themselves.
This involved placing a scale, a Northing and colour grid, as well as a slate that identifies the trench, the date and personnel responsible for the work within the frame as the photo was taken (see @fig-photography).
However, the information that these devices were meant to convey was quite imprecise and served more as "hints" on how to proceed with an investigation rather than as truly reliable foundations for knowledge construction.

![Archaeological photography in the field involves relating the photograph to other records about the object being photographed.](figures/photography.png){#fig-photography}

Moreover, photographers were required to capture "complete sets" of photos, i.e. photos of a trench opening and closing, with and without a photo board for each instance.
In this sense, archaeological photography became just one aspect of formulaic data-collection procedures, and was regarded with a checklist mentality.
It was common for trench supervisors to become impatient and eager to move on to other work, while neglecting to set up their frame in a manner that would have ensured higher visual quality.
They also often took more photos than were necessary and opted to sort through them later to find the best ones, but this did not ensure that any of the photos were of good quality; the photographer instead had to choose the best of a set of poor options, which is hardly optimal [similar observations were also made by @knoll2019].

Despite difficulties working in such relatively inconsistent and uncontrollable environments, the strong association between photos and _records of_ photos contributed to a treatment of archaeological photography as a form of data collection.
This was apparent in my observations that data management specialists, frustrated with inconsistent or missing data in the sets of photos that they were responsible with curating and the logs that they were responsible for normalizing, directed fieldworkers to do photography in ways that conformed with data management protocols.

This was especially evident when photography was performed by trench supervisors instead of a dedicated field photographer, as was the case in Case A.
Trench supervisors were instructed to capture a specific set of images when triggered by certain events, e.g., when opening and closing a trench or after identifying a significant archaeological feature, and these instructions also told them how to optimize the outputs of their efforts, e.g. managing lighting and eliminating problematic shadows.
However, the significance and value of this work was rarely communicated to the fieldworkers who actually took the photographs.
Instead, the creative acts of designing a photography protocol, selecting and configuring equipment, and establishing how to process relevant information about a photograph were delegated to those who served a managerial role.
Archaeological photography was thereby directed by workflows, which are disciplined ways of working and that involve a shift in the relative power held by human and non-human agents involved in an activity.

More generally, the adoption of workflows in archaeological photography may be partially attributable to technological change.
When photography relied on film as a medium for capturing images of archaeological entities, which was relatively scarce and took lots of time to develop into finished photographs, photography was a specialist activity.
A sole photographer who carried specialized instruments (digital single-lens reflex [DSLR] camera, scales, and light meter) would be called upon to take all official photos of noteworthy finds and features [cf. @dorrell1994; @shanks2013].
But technological advances in digital photography that have become widely available over the past two to three decades, including instant image rendering, cheap and plentiful digital storage, fast electronic file transfer, and reduced or eliminated cost of equipment (e.g., dark rooms, developing fluid, flash bulbs), made it possible to reduce, and even eliminate, the need for a specialist photographer in most archaeological projects.
Now fieldworkers may be quickly trained on the job or be made to follow standard photography protocols using widely available and relatively high-quality cameras, or even using cameras integrated into their own smartphones.

Archaeological fieldworkers can thus be made to capture objects visually according to predefined protocols, stimulated by certain triggering conditions, and using the cheapest approach available.
It is not necessary to waste time training photographers to understand how a camera works and how to set up their equipment in a manner that yields good results, when it is more efficient to delegate these creative acts to experts who design systems and document the operational specifications in excavation manuals that fieldworkers are expected to follow blindly.
Fieldworkers are rarely taught how a piece of equipment works; instead, they are taught how to operate it.

That being said, @morgan2018 also drew attention to the ways in which archaeological photography, including acts of image manipulation, can enhance archaeological understanding if performed in ways that are reminiscent of the intimate engagements necessary to generate informative illustrations of entities encountered during fieldwork, such as archaeological illustration, which remains a relatively specialized activity.
As a document about the archaeological encounter, a photo must be created by someone who knows what they have recovered and why it is significant.
For this reason, archaeological illustration also remains a constituent of archaeological fieldwork, and has not become simply an extension of the data-management domain.
However, there have been attempts to do precisely this, particularly through digital annotation of archaeological photographs and certain applications of photogrammetry [@morgan2018].
But these attempts have met resistance through the same mechanism that makes archaeological illustration unique, namely an effort to situate these practices as activities that primarily deal with archaeological encounters rather than as creating simulacra of archaeological objects.

---

The case of photogrammetry, also known as structure-from-motion imaging, warrants further consideration.
Photogrammetry operates by inferring three-dimensional geometry from a series of two-dimensional images of an object taken from multiple overlapping perspectives.
The points of overlap serve as common reference points for construction of a unified three-dimensional model.
I observed this process at Case B, as performed by Rufus, who, aside from being one of the project's co-directors, is a pioneering figure in the use of photogrammetry in archaeological fieldwork settings.

Before photogrammetric imaging could begin, it was necessary to identify an object of interest, and for fieldworkers to expend a great deal of effort to clear light debris and particulate matter from all around the target object.
The area was then cleared of all equipment and personnel, save for spatial targets placed around the object whose precise locations were later recorded with the differential GPS (DGPS).
Wielding a high-resolution digital camera, Rufus framed in his mind the area around the object as if it were at the centre of a conical grid.
Starting in one position, he proceeded to take a series of photos of the object, shifting his position by moving one step laterally around the object before each shot.
Once he completed the circuit around the object, he took a step back and repeated the process, effectively walking a series of concentric circles around the object.
Afterward, he went right up to the object and took a few more detailed photos up close and from perspectives whose angles intersect at more acute angles.
As he moved, Rufus was wary to not cast shadows on the object of interest.
Once he captures all the photos, Chris came in with the DGPS rover and recorded the locations of the spatial targets.
These were subsequently used to calibrate the spatial measurements and rectify the model against local and global geographic coordinate systems.<sup>[B4](#sec-B4)</sup>

After returning to the dig house, Rufus transferred the photos to his computer and sorted through them.
He imported them into Agisoft PhotoScan, a software suite that facilitates "stitching together" a 3D model from multiple constituent photographs.
He visually examined each image and discarded those that he believed would disrupt the model based on his prior experience, which enabled him to anticipate which input images would produce poor-quality 3D renders.
The software then identified points that various photos have in common and inferred three-dimensional geometry based on the shifting perspectives among them.
Rufus then inspected the 3D model to determine whether there were any smudged or imprecise areas and re-calibrated the software parameters to account for any imperfections.
He drew from his years of practical experience, as well as deliberate and controlled tests that applied different parameters on relatively simple toy datasets, to guide his decisions in calibrating the software.<sup>[B4](#sec-B4)</sup>

In other words, photogrammetry involved a very precise and intentional set of actions that Rufus coordinated in a manner which foresaw potential issues in subsequent stages of work.
He performed his work with particular outcomes in mind, specifically the ability to obtain a precise and georeferenced model against which object distributions can be mapped.
For Rufus, his knowledge of how the mechanism works and his ability to assemble his own creation from basic components and principles are what sets his work apart as a specialist in this matter.<sup>[B5](#sec-B5)</sup>
There exist more general-purpose tools (i.e. smartphone apps like 123D Catch) that enable creation of similar-looking outputs by following a simplified set of instructions in the app (presumably written by the app's developers), but Rufus did not consider the people who use those tools to be photogrammetry experts due to their lack of creative agency in the overall process.

Interestingly, in an unrecorded conversation Rufus expressed his belief that photogrammetry is a fieldwork practice, rather than something that "digital archaeologists" with little fieldwork experience should perform.
It is a drawn-out activity that necessitates direct engagement and familiarity with the object of interest.
In thinking about how each stage of the photogrammetry workflow will affect the next and eventually culminate in a compiled image, Rufus and Liz (a very experienced trench supervisor at Case B) recognized the impacts that their decisions made at various stages in the process had on the final product, for example, when clearing debris or when discarding blurry photographs.<sup>[B6](#sec-B6), [B7](#sec-B7)</sup>
Rufus values awareness of the context of creation and holding an involved connection with the process through which the dataset is developed.

In all of this, a clear tension is evident with regards to the treatment of visual media either as products that stand in as relatively stable representations of objects of interest, or as manifestations of cumulative archaeological engagements.
Attempts to systematize creation of visual media largely focused on the outcomes of work, and seek ways to de-emphasize the subjective nature of archaeological documentation so as to instill confidence in the outcomes' immutability.
This is accomplished by elevating tools as actors that dominate human action, or by reducing people's actions as being akin to the use of tools.
<!-- Resistances to these efforts tended to be most prominent in cases where the agency of the people who capture visual media was deemed more valuable than the information objects that derive from work processes. -->

## Collecting and managing spatial data
Archaeologists are very concerned with accounting for spatial distributions of the objects they recover.
Every artefact, feature or interface an archaeologist encounters can be characterized in spatial terms.
Here I will describe various techniques that archaeologists have developed to help systematize the collection and integration of spatial information, and relate these practices to emerging tensions pertaining to the coordination of labour and data.

A common fieldwork practice in archaeology is the use of site grids [@roskams2001: 95-101], which were also employed in the cases I observed.
The purpose of site grids is to place highly localized observations within broader integrated systems, namely the project's geographical information system (GIS).
Site grids are created by marking a series of points in the physical landscape with project-specific geospatial coordinates.
These points may also correspond with internationally-recognized global coordinate systems, but projects tend to conduct day-to-day operations based on their own grid systems.
Each trench is therefore located near a point with fixed spatial coordinates, and the trench's spatial dimensions can be inferred by measuring distances from that fixed point.
These derived locations, whose positions are now known, can then be used to infer an extended network of known points by measuring and calculating the differences between the distances from target points to known points.
In other words, fieldworkers leverage the web of inferred points to determine and record the positions of their interventions and of the things that they recover.

In the cases I observed, fieldworkers initially recorded the positions of their finds in relational terms, i.e. as distances in relation to the fixed points from which they measure (see @fig-spatial-relational and @fig-spatial-recording).\textsuperscript{\ref{A12} \ref{B8}}
When finalizing their paperwork, they sometimes took on the task of calculating fixed positions from the relational distances they initially measured and recorded, but this was not really deemed as an essential task within their purview.\textsuperscript{\ref{A15}}
Instead, this work of converting measured distances into coordinates on the site grid themselves was often delegated to specialists who work with geospatial data.\textsuperscript{\ref{B8}}
This contributed to a general distinction between the domain of fieldwork, which was responsible for initial data-recording procedures, and the domain of data management, which was responsible for conversioning, formatting and cleaning data for analytical and interpretive purposes.

![Recording spatial information in relational terms.](figures/spatial-relational.png){#fig-spatial-relational}

![Recording spatial information in the field. \textbf{[A]} depicts a system that measures distance in relation to trench entities. \textbf{[B]} depicts a geospatial specialist and a fieldworker determining an object's position using a digital theodolite.](figures/spatial-recording.png){#fig-spatial-recording}

However this enactment of institutional boundaries did not necessarily reflect fieldworkers' lack of interest in relating their efforts as part of broader geospatial networks.\textsuperscript{\ref{A17} \ref{A18}}
Rather, it conveyed fieldworkers' extreme sense of focus on the trenches or grids under their direct purview.
The grids established by geospatial specialists effectively enabled field supervisors to relate their own engagements within their respective trenches and transects to the broader grid, in a way that required less mental overhead on their part.

Moreover, the indirect relationships that fieldworkers had with the formal site grid served as a way of maintaining fieldworkers' unique perspectives on the things they encountered.
A trench was somewhat detached from the rest of the world in the sense that a supervisor and her assistants developed their own understanding of it and its features.
They referred to specific boulders by given names, attributed personalities to certain corners, and were able to communicate about specific entities even while using the vaguest of terms (i.e., "that rock," "over there," "behind you").\textsuperscript{\ref{A14} \ref{A16} \ref{A19}}
Fieldworkers felt _obliged_ to record formal distances between entities and were bemused by the stock that data managers and analysts put into these formal values.\textsuperscript{\ref{A20}}
They dealt with the fuzzy boundaries between strata and the loose distinctions between natural and cultural material on a day-to-day basis, and recognized that relational associations, rather than formal recording techniques, were better suited for capturing these aspects of the archaeological record.

Working with string, measuring tapes and plumbobs allowed fieldworkers to operate in this relational manner and communicate using the local lexicon of their trench.
At the same time, this also provided outputs that were deemed necessary to conduct a thorough integrated analysis and to relate the self-contained sub-system of the trench to a global spatial infrastructure.

However, the gradual uptick in the use of precise DGPS systems may be altering this balance.
DGPS systems, such as the one used in Case B, enable fieldworkers to determine an object's fixed position without having to convert between as many relational measurements.
While it is true that DGPS positions are inferred, using a rover in relation to a more sensitive GPS unit situated in a fixed location, the people who use this system need only to measure a single point to determine the object's position. Software handles the conversions for them.
Moreover, these off-the-shelf tools express each position according to global coordinate systems, rather than the project-specific grid system.
Chris, who operated the DGPS for Case B, really valued this, since it enabled him to instantly visualize the points on maps downloaded from the web, which feature additional data and aspects of the surrounded built landscape that he did not have to add in himself.<sup>[B9](#sec-B9)</sup>
The reduced mental overhead and the enhanced ease of use encouraged the team to record immense amounts of spatial data, and essentially all their photographs and photogrammetric models are georeferenced as a result.

Fieldworkers were therefore made to think of the data they collect strictly in terms of contributing to a dataset and as feeding into a subsequent stage of work.<sup>[B8](#sec-B8), [B9](#sec-B9), [B10](#sec-B10)</sup>
As such, fieldworkers' labour was framed as part of a larger workflow, which prioritizes an output in which they have no direct stake.
Fieldworkers were brought into, and fieldwork was performed in service of, the domain of data management, rather than performing work that granted them more creative agency.
